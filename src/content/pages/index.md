# Who am I?

I graduated with a Bachelor of Professional Writing from Carnegie Mellon University and a minor in Psychology. I am skilled in writing - mind you, I should be, seeing as I also got a Master's in Professional Writing the year after. My subjects have predicates, my noun phrases are crisp, my verbs are connective, my adverbs descriptice, my adjectives delicious, my will's not malicious, I hate doing dishes.

My current website is found here. There you can find my portfolio, resume, and contact form. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Here is another paragraph that I think is really important.
